# SQL-Queries---Rockbuster-Stealth-Data-Analysis
This repository includes SQL queries which answers various business questions for a video rental company called Rockbuster.

Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis project deals with the launch strategy for a new online video service for Rockbuster Stealth LLC. In order to help with the strategy, various SQL queries were created to answer business questions. This was done because Rockbuster required data driven answers in order to help with their company strategy in 2020. The dataset that was used for analysis contains information about Rockbuster's film inventory, customers, payments, staff details, addresses and other movie attributes.

Below are the links to the visualizations that I had created after extracting the required data for analysis using SQL :
